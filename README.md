# 🌍 Air Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning  

## 📌 Overview  
Air pollution is one of the most serious threats to human health and the environment. This project, **Air Quality Prediction Using Machine Learning**, aims to predict the **Air Quality Index (AQI)** by analyzing pollutants such as **PM2.5, PM10, SO₂, NO₂, CO, and O₃**.  

By leveraging **machine learning models**, the project not only forecasts air quality levels but also provides valuable insights into pollution trends, helping policymakers, researchers, and the public to take preventive measures.
